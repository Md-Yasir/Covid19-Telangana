                        <p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
                            coronavirus.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory
                            illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with
                            underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory
                            disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
                        </p>
                        <p> The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19
                            virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection
                            by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
                        </p>
                        <p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose
                            when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice
                            respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
                        </p>
                        <p>At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are
                            many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide
                            updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.
